# ALGORITHMS

- An algorithm is a set of well-defined instructions to solve a particular problem.
- One problem can be solve in many ways using different algorithms. Every algorithm comes with it's own tradeoffs when it come to performance.
- We evaluate the performance of an algorithm in terms of it's input size.

### BIG O NOTATION

- When writing algorithms we are only interested in worst case scenerio so we use big O notation to calculate time and space complexity of an algorithm.
- #### Time Complexity
  - Amount of time taken by an algorithm to run.
  - **O(1)** Constant time complexity
  - **O(n)** Linear time complexity, as the input size increases, the time to execute the algorithm will also increase.
  - **O(logn)** Logarithmic time complexity, input size reduces by half on every iteration.
  - **O(n!)** Factorial - An algorithm is said to have a factorial time complexity when it grows in a factorial way based on the size of the input data.
- ### Space Complexity
  - Amount of memory taken by an algorithm to run.
  - **O(1)** Constant - memory does not increase when the inpute size increases.
  - **O(n)** Linear - memory usage increases as the input size increases.
  - **O(logn)** Logarithmic - memory usage grows but not at the same rate as the input size.

### MATH

Below are a few math skills that are important for learning and implementing algorithms.
